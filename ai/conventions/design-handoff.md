# Design handoff workflow

How design work flows between Claude Design (the design-time agent
producing HTML/CSS/SVG mockups) and Claude Code / human
contributors on the implementation side.

Born from the observation that ad-hoc per-prompt loops produced
high friction: each microdecision triggered a full round-trip
through a human router (you). This document fixes the contract.

## Roles

| Role                          | Owns                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design** (Claude Design)    | Production of visual deliverables (HTML mockups, SVG assets, copy structure) |
| **Server** (Claude Code + me) | Code implementation, ADRs, integration, tests                                |
| **User** (you)                | Decisions on open questions, routing PRs, the final call on trade-offs       |
| **Reviewer agent**            | Closure check before each phase transition                                   |

Decisions about **the design system itself** (tokens, anti-patterns,
typography) live in `./design`. Decisions about **architecture or
the product** live in `docs/decisions/`. Design reads both; Design
does not author either — only proposes deltas that user / Server
ratify.

## The single source of truth

The Design-facing source is **`./design/brief.md`**. It carries:

- Read-only context (decisions, tokens, route map, anti-patterns)
- Phase asks (current deliverables Design is producing)
- Delivery schema (how Design ships)
- Open questions table (with owner + status)
- Closure criteria

The brief is **versioned** with the rest of the repo. Each Design
batch starts from the brief's current state at a known commit. When
the brief changes materially mid-batch, Design is notified via the
PR description (or in the `## Open questions` table).

Design does NOT need to read individual ADRs, the product vision, or
the handoff bundle directly. The brief digests everything Design
needs. The other docs are referenced for the deeper "why" but not
required reading.

Mockups are plain HTML + **Tailwind v4** (no shadcn/ui, no component
library). Tokens map 1:1 to the Tailwind v4 theme so implementation
stays traceable to the handoff.

## Delivery schema

Design ships into `./design/v<N>/` (the current handoff version; e.g.
`./design/v3/`). Each batch is a self-contained set with a fixed
structure:

```
design/v3/
├── README.md          ← decisions, trade-offs, open questions
├── Transmissão.html   ← live-match screen mockup
├── bracket.html
├── thirds.html
└── assets/            ← optional, scoped to this delivery
    └── ...
```

The README is required. It carries:

```markdown
# <Topic name> — <date>

## What's in this batch

- One-line per deliverable

## Decisions made during production

- Bulleted list of choices that needed flagging (e.g. "Showed the
  best-thirds table inline under the bracket on mobile instead of a
  separate tab, to keep the live cross-pairing visible at a glance")

## Anti-patterns avoided

- Specific to this batch (e.g. "Did NOT animate every score update
  with a full-screen confetti burst — that's an AI-slop pattern
  flagged in the design system")

## Open questions raised

- Numbered, with owner suggestion. These propagate to brief.md
  `## Open questions` table on integration.

## Acceptance against the brief

- For each ask in brief.md addressed by this batch, a one-line
  confirmation OR a deviation note with reason.
```

Files in the batch folder follow the brief's per-ask format
(HTML for mockups, SVG for assets, etc.).

## Open questions protocol

Open questions live ONLY in `./design/brief.md` `## Open
questions` table. The shape is fixed:

| Q   | Asked by | Date       | Owner  | Status   | Resolution              |
| --- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------- |
| 001 | Design   | 2026-05-18 | User   | Open     | —                       |
| 002 | Server   | 2026-05-18 | Design | Resolved | "Yes, OKLCH everywhere" |

When Design raises a question in a delivery README, Server moves it
into the brief on integration. When Server raises a question, it
goes into the brief directly and the brief is the source of truth.

User answers in-table (Resolution column) or in a comment on the
brief's PR. Either way, the answer is permanent once recorded.

Mid-batch, neither side waits for an open question to be resolved
unless it blocks the batch. If it blocks, escalate (see below).

## Escape: `design-block` issue

A `design-block` GitHub issue is opened when **a decision blocks
delivery and the answer is not obvious from existing docs**. Use
sparingly:

- Security / legal trade-offs (the typical case)
- Decisions that imply a new ADR
- Cross-cutting choices that contradict an existing ADR

Format:

- Title: `design-block: <one-line question>`
- Label: `design-block` + relevant `scope:*` label
- Body: context, options, recommendation, deadline
- Assignee: User

NOT a `design-block`:

- Aesthetic preferences (Design's call within the design-system constraints)
- Internal Design questions about HTML structure
- Server-side implementation choices

## Cadence

- **Brief update**: as often as needed, but every update PR
  references the affected sections so Design can read incrementally.
- **Design batch**: roughly 1 per session. Could be 1 deliverable
  or 5; the trigger is "this is a coherent set that should ship
  together."
- **Server integration**: 1 PR per delivery batch. Should land
  within ~2 days of delivery.
- **Phase closure**: explicit gate. Reviewer agent runs through the
  checklist; nothing crosses into the next phase before it passes.

## What this workflow does NOT manage

- **Day-to-day code**. Features build per `docs/playbooks/feature.md`
  (the 4-phase gated spec-driven flow). Design assets show up only
  where needed; most features don't trigger Design work.
- **Long-running design decisions** (e.g. "should the brand evolve?").
  Those go through ADRs the normal way.
- **Brand emergencies** (a designed pattern reveals a security or
  accessibility bug). Handle as a regular bug fix per the bugfix
  playbook; loop Design in via brief update.
