# ai/skills/

Skills and MCP integrations the project has adopted, and a curated map
of what we considered, deferred, or rejected.

## Source of truth

Each skill we adopt lives under `ai/skills/<name>/` with a `SKILL.md`
(Claude Code skill format with YAML frontmatter) or a `README.md` (for
plugins / CLIs that aren't loaded as a context skill). Tool-specific
bindings (`.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `opencode.json`) are
thin pointers — edit content here, not in the pointers. A binding de
MCP (`.mcp.json`) ainda não existe no repo: a integração do Supabase
MCP é opcional e está a configurar.

## Active pack

As skills `vercel-*` são tratadas como guias genéricos de React/web —
valem para nosso stack Vite, mesmo não sendo Next.

Browsing the **anthropics/skills** upstream catalog
([github.com/anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills))
is encouraged when a new need emerges — adopt selectively via the
same vendoring pattern.

## How to add a new skill

1. Decide where it sits: vendor (SKILL.md copied/pointed locally) or
   install-via-tool (CLI / marketplace).
2. Create `ai/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (vendored) or
   `ai/skills/<name>/README.md` (install-via-tool) with:
   - Frontmatter (name, description) for SKILL.md
   - Source URL with pinned commit / version when possible
   - One paragraph summary of what it does
   - When to invoke it
   - Hand-off to which agent role
3. Add tool bindings:
   - `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — thin wrapper pointing at
     `ai/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   - `.cursor/rules/<NNN>-skill-<name>.mdc` — manual rule
   - `opencode.json` — add path to `instructions[]`
4. Update this README's tables.
5. If the skill changes how agents work, update the relevant agent
   file's "Required reading" section.

## How to use a skill from a session

- **Claude Code**: `@<skill-name>` in a prompt, or rely on auto-routing
  via the description field in frontmatter.
- **Cursor**: `@rule-name` (where rule name is the MDC file's stem) or
  enable a rule via the rules panel.
- **Codex CLI**: reference the file in your prompt: "read
  `ai/skills/spec-driven/SKILL.md` and follow it for this task."
- **OpenCode**: skills referenced in `opencode.json instructions[]`
  are loaded automatically.
